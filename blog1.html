    Hello! My name is Ryan and I am an aspiring data scientist living in New York. I'm looking forward to learning how to analyze large datasets using 
computational models. To put it vaguely, my interest in computer science stems from my love of building things and my penchant for collaboration. To specify, 
I have a story about building Legos.

#Building

    I recently went over my cousin's house for Sunday dinner and helped her young sons build a lego castle (freestyle, from a bin of assorted lego blocks).
As we constructed the castle I started thinking about the hours I spent as a child tirelessly building structures, vehicles, etc. with my legos, and how terribly
inefficient a builder I was! Manually sorting through blocks to get the right color and shape, mentally creating each new blueprint from scratch, 
and being forced to dismantle large sections of my creations to make minor changes. Maybe a more resourceful child could've build one machine to automatically
sort blocks by color and shape, another to lay out paramaters for the foundational design of my structures and vehicles, another machine to assemble and connect
blocks, and another to remove the minimum number of blocks possible to implement a design change. Imagine how quickly and efficiently that child could make his
ideas come to life!
    This story represents how I view the power of computer science. Through automation and segmentation, we are able to access incredible efficiencies. We can 
write groupings of code that allow us to streamline computational processes and achive our goals more quickly. In the case of a data scientist, these goals 
revolve around cleaning, sorting, and analyzing data sets that would be unmanageable otherwise. So instead of building each "Lego castle" from scratch, we create
code packets that basically build the castle for us. Then once we have our code set up, we can easily modify it to build entire Lego villages! What a cool idea!

#Teamwork

    The second element of applied computer science that appeals to me is the collaborative element. When a group of coders collaborate on a project,
they can use their unique proficiencies to individually complete different segments of code before merging them together. This allows us to combine all 
of our Lego villages to createa whole Lego world! I've already experienced this in my DS classroom, where students have been helping each other fill in
knowledge/understanding gaps in between lectures.
    My goal in this class is to increase my own knowledge and understanding of coding syntax and processes so that i may not only become an effective coder,
but an effective collaborator as well.

My coding journey starts here, and I'm excited to see where it leads!
